# Bulk Emailing Script with Rotations
I developed this script as part of a freelance project to simplify the process of sending bulk emails. It efficiently incorporates email rotations for better deliverability and variation. With this tool, users can send large batches of emails while rotating between different templates, subjects, or sender addresses to avoid spam filters and enhance engagement. The script automates the entire process, ensuring that each recipient receives personalized content with minimal effort on the sender's part.

# Key Features:
Sender Email and Password Management: I designed the script to support multiple sender accounts. The credentials for these accounts should be stored in an Excel file (.xlsx format) with two columns:

Email: The senderâ€™s email address.
Password: The corresponding password or app-specific password for each account.
Receiver Email List: The recipients' email addresses need to be provided in a text file (.txt format), with one email address per line.

Customizable Email Rotation: The script asks for user input to define the rotation parameters. Users can decide how often to rotate the sender accounts, for example, after every 'X' emails. This provides flexibility and helps optimize performance by minimizing the risk of email throttling or getting blocked by service providers.

This bulk emailing script provides a highly efficient and customizable solution for sending large volumes of emails. By incorporating flexible rotation options, easy deployment, and seamless sender management, it helps ensure that emails reach recipients without getting caught in spam filters. Whether you're a marketer, business owner, or freelancer, this tool simplifies email outreach while maximizing engagement with minimal setup effort.
