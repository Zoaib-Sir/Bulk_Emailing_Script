# Bulk Emailing Script
This script is designed to send bulk emails efficiently while incorporating email rotations for optimal deliverability and variation. It allows users to send large batches of emails while rotating through different email templates, subjects, or sender addresses, helping to avoid spam filters and improve engagement. The script automates the process, ensuring that each recipient gets personalized content with minimal effort from the sender.

<u>Key Features:</u>
Sender Email and Password Management: The script supports multiple sender accounts. Sender credentials should be stored in an Excel file (.xlsx format) with two columns:

Email: The senderâ€™s email address.
Password: The corresponding password or app-specific password for each account.
Receiver Email List: Recipients' email addresses should be provided in a text file (.txt format), with one email address per line.

Customizable Email Rotation: The script asks for user input to define the rotation parameters. Users can specify how frequently the sender accounts should rotate, for instance, after every 'X' emails. This flexibility allows for tailored email rotations to optimize performance and avoid potential email throttling or blocking by email service providers.
